        <p>
            Our creamy cavatappi recipe gets its richness from authentic Italian cacio e pepe sauce, which has just four ingredients (two of which are cheese) making this speedy weeknight pasta an easy favorite.

        <div class="list-container">
            <ul>
                <li>¾ pound cavatappi pasta</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons freshly cracked black pepper, plus more to taste</li>
                <li>1¼ cups finely grated Pecorino Romano</li>
            </ul>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook until al dente according to the package instructions. 
                    Reserve 1 cup of pasta water and drain.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is glistening, 
                    add the pepper and cook, swirling the pan until fragrant, about 1 minute. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add ½ cup of the reserved pasta water to the pan and bring to a simmer. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove the skillet from heat. Add the pasta, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and Pecorino Romano and toss until combined and the cheese has melted. If necessary, add more pasta water, 1 tablespoon at a time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To serve, sprinkle with more pepper and Parmigiano-Reggiano, if desired.
                </li>
            </ol>
